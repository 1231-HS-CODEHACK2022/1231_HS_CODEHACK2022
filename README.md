The code is prepared on a small scale medical assistance scheme.



   Details: We begin our program with asking the user about the
   symptoms from a given list. For now, we take 5 sets into
   consideration. The control proceed as per the choice from the
   user. For every choice, the user will be provided with a list of
   doctors, their contact numbers and pin code, but as far as now we
   have completely focused on pin codes of a particular city.
